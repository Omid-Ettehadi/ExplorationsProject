Project Description:

As artists, the Internet has enabled us to share our works, 
interact with our audiences, and in recent years has given 
us the ability to sell our designs. Although the Internet can
provide great visuals of the work with amazing sound, 
some works of art are meant to be touched. 
The texture is a fundamental element of a 
three-dimensional art. By being able to touch the work
you find a stronger connection with it, fulfilling the
whole experience of the work. My vision is to design 
a website where you can touch the work of art that you
are interested in before purchasing it, through the use
of an external device that can adjust itself to mimic 
the work of art. This allows the user to get the full 
experience in shopping and helps the artist to better 
communicate the meaning of their work.

This project involves creation of a website where users can
submit their work, and purhcase other's work. It is a platform to
share your designs while focusing on giving the full experience
to the viewers.
