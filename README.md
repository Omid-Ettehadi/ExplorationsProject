Project Description:

As artists, the Internet has enabled us to share our works, interact with 
our audiences,and in recent years has given us the ability to sell our 
designs. According to Gotham Magazine, almost 50 % of the Generation Y
art buyers use Instagram as their platform for art related purposes, but
the experience of the buyer is limited to a visual picture of the work.
Although the Internet can provide great visuals of the work, some works
of art are meant to be touched. The texture is one of the fundamental 
elements of three-dimensional art. Without the ability to hold the art, 
the experience will never be full. The vision of this design is to provide
the opportunity to the users to touch the work of art that they are interested
in before purchasing it, through the use of an external device that can adjust
itself to simulate the sensation of touching the artwork, allowing the artist to
express the meaning of their work. This will enhance the experience of the buyers
and allow artists to better communicate the message of their work through the 
internet.

Status:

- What works:
The main layout for the website is working:
    o There is a slideshow on the first page where it goes through all the pictures
       of the artwork in the website.
    o There is a page for login or creating an account.
    o There is a page where all the works are shown, where the user can select the
      work by clicking on it and see more details about the work.

- What doesn't work:
• You cannot create an account.
    o I currently lack the knowledge to connect the website to an sql database in
      order to store the user’s detail.
• You cannot add the object to your cart.
    o I was able to find libraries that would allow me to allow the user to purchase
      items, but I did not have enough time to implement them and use them in the
       website.
• You cannot upload your own files.
• You cannot search.
    o The structure and layout of the website took longer time than expected
      leaving no time to implement this function.

As I was mainly focused on styling of the website, I found this site where
it showed different and interesting designs for buttons.
